The Story Mode has three scenarios: Chronophantasma, Sector Seven and Six Heroes. \n\nJanuary, 2200AD \nIt's been over one week since the loop came to an end. \nHaving destroyed the Cauldrons, Ragna had finished his quest.\n\nHowever... \nThere was still unfinished business in his books. \nTo defeat his now-revived nemesis, Terumi.\nTerumi abducts the Successor of the Azure, Noel, and forces the Master Unit, Amaterasu to appear in the human plane. \nHatred and vengeance awaken the Sword of the Godslayer, Kusanagi (Mu -No.12-).\n\nRagna sacrifices his own flesh and blood to save Noel, but even that Terumi had predicted. \nIn a small window of opportunity, Terumi nullifies Takamagahara.\n\nIt was all a part of their— \nThe NOL's highest commanding leader, the Imperator's will. \nLater, Kokonoe restores Ragna's flesh... \n...and he sets his course for the Federation's Hierarchical City: Ikaruga.\nLittle did he know, he would encounter the phantoms of time, the Chronophantasma, at his destination.\n\n[From Blazblue Wiki]	Chrono_Phantasma			\N	20160312	{en,ja,ko,zh}	{en,ja,ko,zh}	{win}	\N	\N	0	\N

They were rebelling against the ruler "Imperator" by their own reason.\n\nAs an answer for the consequences, the mankind all over the world were decomposed into "Seithr". While the power inside Ragna was forcibly provoked to be out of control by the Imperator.\n\nThereafter, the Imperator has vanished somewhere, leaving the huge black sphere called the "Embryo". And Ragna was lost, after he transformed into his internal existence, the "Black Beast".\n\nHowever... Ragna is still alive. When he gained consciousness at the 13th Hierarchical City "Kagutsuchi", the power of the Black Beast was sedated. Moreover, he was still himself though, he lost all of his memory.\n\n"Now time to rebel against the end."\n\n[From Blazblue Wiki]\n\nThe most notable update in the game is that the Arcade has now three Acts instead of just featuring 8 battles. The first Act is named "Phantom of Labyrinth", while the second one is "Nightmare Memory", and the last and third one is called "The Replacement Blue".				\N	20170426	{en,ja,ko}	{en,ja,ko}	{win}	\N	\N	0	\N
