The VNDB.org Source Code
------------------------


Installation & documentation

  Documentation is lacking, you're pretty much on your own if you want to
  get things running. :-(

  Development notes for specific features or ideas can be found in data/notes/.
  Keep in mind, however, that these notes are often mostly technical and may
  not reflect the actual (current) implementation. They do elaborate on various
  design decisions and may be useful for understanding how certain things work.
