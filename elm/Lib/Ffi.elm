-- Elm 0.19: "We've removed all Native modules and plugged all XSS vectors,

-- Me: "Oh yeah? I'll just run sed over the generated Javascript!"

-- This module is a hack to work around the lack of an FFI (Foreign Function
-- Interface) in Elm. The functions in this module are stubs, their
-- implementations are replaced by the Makefile with calls to
-- window.elmFfi_<name> and the actual implementations are in Ffi.js.
--
-- Use sparingly, all of this will likely break in future Elm versions.

-- Format a floating point number with a fixed number of fractional digits.
