:SUB:Tag voting
<p>
 While everyone is pretty much free to link any tag to any visual novel, please keep the following
 in mind while voting:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Read the description of each tag before you link it to a VN, some tags may not always mean what
  you think they do.</li>
 <li>Try to be as specific as you can. For example, if a game has drama elements, rather than voting
  on the "Drama" tag, try to look for a more specific child tag that describes what kind of drama a
  player can expect.</li>
 <li>A rating between -3 and 3 can be given to a tag. A negative rating indicates that you disagree
  with a tag, with -1 being "I wouldn't say this tag really applies" and -3 meaning you fully disagree
  and the tag really doesn't apply at all. A positive rating works the opposite way, and indicates
  that you do agree with it.</li>
 <li>Some tags can act as spoilers for the plot of a VN, this can be indicated by voting on the spoiler
  status. It is highly recommended to not leave this as "Neutral", and really try to give an indication
  of whether the tag is not a spoiler at all or does spoil a bit.</li>
</ul>


:SUB:Tag guidelines
<p>
 New tags can be requested by everyone, but they'll have to be accepted by a moderator before
 the tags will be browsable. The following rules apply:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Tag names should be self-describing. While the meaning of a tag can be obvious if you look
  at its place within the tag tree, when displayed on a VN page only their name is visible and
  not the parent tags. The name should thus fully describe what the tag means and should be used
  for. For example: a tag to describe a male protagonist should be fully named "Male protagonist",
  even if its parent tag is "Characters &gt; Protagonist".</li>
 <li>Tags should be used to describe objective information about a VN. Subjective tags like
  "Awesome protagonist", which would have a different meaning for each individual, are not allowed.</li>
</ul>
