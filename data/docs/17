:TITLE:VNDB Interface Translation
:INC:index

:SUB:Introduction
<p>
 Translation of the VNDB interface happens in roughly the following steps: 
</p>
<ol>
 <li>You contact Yorhel that you're interested in maintaining a translation
   into some language.</li>
 <li>You will be granted access to the translation admin (see below) so you can
   translate stuff.</li>
 <li>When you're done (or, when you feel you've translated enough to have a
   useful translation), you can contact Yorhel again and he can move the
   translation to the main website.</li>
</ol>
<p>
 Be warned that VNDB has quite a lot of text to translate, so doing a full
 translation might take some time. Also keep in mind that the translations will
 need to be kept up-to-date when changes to the site are made.
</p>


:SUB:Translation Admin
<p>
 The translation admin interface is available on a separate installation of
 VNDB. It can be reached on the following URL:<br />
 <a href="http://vndbtl.blicky.net/tladmin">http://vndbtl.blicky.net/tladmin</a><br />
 That VNDB installation is completely separated from the main VNDB, so you're
 free to modify things and screw around as much as you like. The changes to the
 database are not saved and may be reverted at any time.<br /><br />
 Make sure to log in to the site if you wish to modify the translation. Changes
 to the translations are saved locally and are directly visible on the test
 site. The changes are not automatically moved on to the main VNDB. You can
 notify Yorhel to move the edited translation to the main website.
 <br /><br />
 <b class="standout">IMPORTANT</b>: When editing translations, make sure to
 save often. It would really suck if you spend an hour translating everything
 on a page, and then forget to save it. Or if you accidentally leave the page
 and can't get back with your changes intact. Or if you wanted to save but the
 server is suddenly having some issues. Whatever happens, be sure to hit the
 "Save" button once every few minutes to limit any trouble!
</p>

:SUBSUB:Sections
<p>
 All the interface text of VNDB is grouped into several <i>sections</i>.
 Selecting a section allows you to view/edit the individual translation lines.
 <br /><br />
 If the translation of a line is the same as the English text, the text box of
 the translation can be left blank. Blank fields are automatically replaced
 with the English text on the site.
 <br /><br />
 Always try to find each translated line used on the actual site and see if it
 looks good in context. Sometimes there are limits to the length of a line and
 the layout will look bad if the translation is too long. At other times you
 might notice that the translation is used in a very different context than you
 had thought.
 <br /><br />
<b>Checkbox</b><br />
 There is a checkbox next to each translation line. This is used for
 administrative purposes and can be used to signal which lines still need to be
 (re)translated. When the English line is modified, or when a new line is
 added, this checkbox will be set. After updating the translation you can unset
 it to mark the line as finished. When, and whether, to unmark the checkbox is
 up to you as translator. The checkboxes are not used for any other purpose
 than to help you keep track of a to-do list. The numbers next to the section
 links at the top indicate how many lines are still checked in that section
 versus the total number of lines.
 <br /><br />
<b>Formatting</b><br />
 Some lines have special formatting codes in them. In most cases you can just
 copy the codes from the original text into the translation and translate
 anything that looks like actual text. Here's a list of the currently used
 formatting codes:
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>[_#] ([_1], [_2], etc)</dt><dd>Placeholder for something that will be replaced in
   the code. You can usually guess from the context what it will be replaced
   with, otherwise it is often explained in the comments.</dd>
 <dt>[age,_#]</dt><dd>Formats a date/time as an age, like "5 days ago".</dd>
 <dt>[br]</dt><dd>Line break</dd>
 <dt>[date,_#]</dt><dd>Formats a date</dd>
 <dt>[date,_#,full]</dt><dd>Formats a date/time</dd>
 <dt>[datestr,_#]</dt><dd>Formats a release date</dd>
 <dt>[url,_#,title]</dt><dd>Formats a link. The title part needs to be translated, the rest should be the same as the original text.</dd>
 <dt>[user,_#]</dt><dd>Formats a username</dd>
 <dt>[index,_#,..]</dt><dd>This code will select one of its items to be
   displayed. For example, "[index,_1,Meta trait,Trait]" is a placeholder for
   either "Meta trait" or "Trait". Both texts should be translated and should
   make sense in the context of the line.</dd>
 <dt>[quant,_#,..]</dt><dd>This one is important. It is used to handle words
   that need to be different depending on a certain number. For example,
   English has only singular and plural forms, so "[quant,_1,vote,votes]" is
   used to select the right word depending on whether it's about a single or
   multiple votes. Czech has three possible forms, so that becomes
   "[quant,_1,hlas,hlasy,hlas≈Ø]". This formatting code can be used in any
   scenario where there is a number, even if the English line is not it.
 </dd>

:SUBSUB:Doc pages
<p>
 Doc pages are pages like the FAQ, guidelines and other stuff. These can be
 translated by editing the document on the right. Doc pages are written in HTML
 and have a few special codes like :TITLE:, :INC:, etc. You don't have to worry
 much about this, just make sure that if there's any codes on the original
 document on the left, the same codes are used in the translated document on
 the right. It helps to keep the line-breaks at the same point in the
 translated document as in the original document, so that it's easy to follow
 which lines correspond to each other.
 <br /><br />
 Doc pages always start with a <b>:TITLE:</b> on the first line and a
 <b>:INC:index</b> on the second. In the translated document it's also possible
 to add a special <b>:INC:incomplete</b> line to indicate that the translation
 is not yet finished or not synchronized with the English version. This line is
 added whenever the English version of the doc page has been changed, and makes
 it easy to see which documents need to be updated. After ensuring that the
 translation has been synchronised, you can remove the <b>:INC:incomplete</b>
 line from the document.
 <br /><br />
 For convenience, in the doc page selection there is a <b
 class="standout">!!</b> indicator next to the doc page to indicate that it has
 not been translated yet, or that it still has a <b>:INC:incomplete</b> line.
 Unfortunately, this indicator is not added when one of the <i>incomplete</i>,
 <i>index</i> or <i>notfinished</i> pages is modified. Be sure to regularly
 check the <i>index</i> page for any additions!
 <br /><br />
 When updating an existing translation for a doc page that has recently been
 modified, it may be useful to see what has been changed exactly. The "Recent
 changes" link at the top-right of the box will bring you to the edit history
 of the English version of the doc page.
 <br /><br />
 The following doc pages are not available for translation:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="/d8">d8</a>: Status and stuff about the VNDB roadmap. Used to change too often to be worth translating.</li>
 <li><a href="/d11">d11</a> &amp; <a href="/d14">d14</a>: Documentation intended for developers, they should learn English.</li>
 <li><a href="/d17">d17</a>: This page. Only useful to (potential) translators, English shouldn't be a problem.</li>
</ul>
