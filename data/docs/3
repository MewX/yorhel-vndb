:SUB:When to add a release
<p>
 A 'release' is a product - either physical or digital - containing (parts of) the
 visual novel. This excludes soundtracks, drama CDs, fandisks, and other products
 that do not contain the visual novel itself.<br />
 All releases should be added seperately. For example, a limited and a regular edition
 shouldn't be combined into one release, even if they share the release date and
 contents. For commercial games, separate releases can be distinguished by their
 JAN/UPC/EAN number.
</p>


:SUB:General info
<dl>
 <dt>Type</dt><dd>
  Is the release complete, partial or a trial version?
  Complete releases have everything.
  Partial releases have most of the game, but there are things still waiting
  to be released.
  Trial versions are heavily cut down and free releases so that you can
  experience a game before you buy it. Sometimes, trial versions are cut
  down for web transmission and do not completely represent the finished product.<br />
  In the case of a translation patch, the type should indicate whether it translates
  the full game (Complete), or just parts of it (Partial).
 </dd><dt>Patch</dt><dd>
  Use this checkbox to indicate that the release is a (translation) patch, used to
  patch an other release.
 </dd><dt>Freeware</dt><dd>
  Check if this box if the game is downloadable (or otherwise distributed) at no cost.
 </dd><dt>Doujin</dt><dd>
  Published by a doujin circle, amateur group or individual, as opposed to a legal
  entity such as a company. This field is ignored when the release type is set to patch.
 </dd><dt>Title (romaji)</dt><dd>
  The name of the release, in the Latin character set (using Romanisation or translation)
 </dd><dt>Original title</dt><dd>
  If the name is officially under a different title (usually because of different
  character sets), put the original title here.
 </dd><dt>Language</dt><dd>
  What language is this release? Use the language that the majority of the game is in.
 </dd><dt>JAN/UPC/EAN</dt><dd>
  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number">GTIN</a> code
  of the product. Often called "JAN" for Japanese releases, "UPC" for USA and Canada
  and "EAN" for Europe. The system will automatically detect the type from the code and 
  use the appropriate term on the release page.
 </dd><dt>Catalog number</dt><dd>
  Catalog number as assigned by the producer. Often used to identify releases on
  webshops, and can usually be found somewhere on the packaging of the product.
 </dd><dt>Official website</dt><dd>
  URL of the official homepage for this product.
 </dd><dt>Release date</dt><dd>
  For commercial games, the sale date.
  For all others, the date on which the release was first available.
  If it was posted on a website, the date on which the post was public.
 </dd><dt>Age rating</dt><dd>
  The minimum age rating for the release. On most releases, this is specified on the
  packaging or on product web pages.
 </dd><dt>Notes</dt><dd>

:SUB:Format
<dl>
 <dt>Resolution</dt><dd>
  Primary/native screen resolution of the game.
 </dd><dt>Voiced</dt><dd>
  Indicates whether this release includes voice acting. <i>Fully voiced</i> indicates
  that all characters (maybe with the exeption of a few minor characters) are voiced in
  all scenes. <i>Only ero scenes voiced</i> speaks for itself, and <i>Partially voiced</i>
  should be used when there is some voice acting, but only for the main characters or only
  in some scenes.
 </dd><dt>Animation</dt><dd>
  Whether the game has any animation can be specified with two seperate options: one for
  the normal story mode and one for the ero scenes, if the game has any. With <i>Simple
  animations</i>, we refer to (usually looping) effects like falling leaves or snow in the
  background or animated facial expressions like blinking eyes and a moving mouth.
  <i>Fully animated scenes</i> refers to non-looping anime-like scenes. Some games are
  entirely like this, others only have a few scenes that are fully animated. Effects like
  moving sprites around the screen, basic zooming and shaking background images are not
  considered as "animations". Minigames or other gameplay elements are excluded as well,
  only the (ADV/VN-like) story parts and ero scenes should be considered.
