:SUB:When to add a release
<p>
 A 'release' is a product - either physical or digital - containing (parts of) the
 visual novel. This excludes soundtracks, drama CDs, fandisks, and other products
 that do not contain the visual novel itself.<br />
 All releases should be added seperately. For example, a limited and a regular edition
 shouldn't be combined into one release, even if they share the release date and
 contents. For commercial games, separate releases can be distinguished by their
 JAN/UPC/EAN number.
</p>


:SUB:General info
<dl>
 <dt>Type</dt><dd>
  Is the release complete, partial or a trial version?
  Complete releases have everything.
  Partial releases have most of the game, but there are things still waiting
  to be released.
  Trial versions are heavily cut down and free releases so that you can
  experience a game before you buy it. Sometimes, trial versions are cut
  down for web transmission and do not completely represent the finished product.
  <br />
  A release may be a patch (most likely, a translation patch against another (fully released)
  release). If this is the case, check the box. The type of a patch should reflect how different
  it is to the original (in terms of translation, the difference of readability, as most
  translations do not affect things like BGM or visuals but are considered "complete").
 </dd><dt>Title (romaji)</dt><dd>
  The name of the release, in the Latin character set (using Romanisation or translation)
 </dd><dt>Original title</dt><dd>
  If the name is officially under a different title (usually because of different
  character sets), put the original title here.
 </dd><dt>Language</dt><dd>
  What language is this release? Use the language that the majority of the game is in.
 </dd><dt>JAN/UPC/EAN</dt><dd>
  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number">GTIN</a> code
  of the product. Often called "JAN" for Japanese releases, "UPC" for USA and Canada
  and "EAN" for Europe. The system will automatically detect the type from the code and 
  use the appropriate term on the release page.
 </dd><dt>Official website</dt><dd>
  URL of the official homepage for this product.
 </dd><dt>Release date</dt><dd>
  For commercial games, the sale date.
  For all others, the date on which the release was first available.
  If it was posted on a website, the date on which the post was public.
 </dd><dt>Age rating</dt><dd>
  The minimum age rating for the release. On most releases, this is specified on the
  packaging or on product web pages.<br />
  Generally:
  <ul>
   <li>an "adult" product is 18+; any game with sexual content is 18+.</li>
   <li>a product with mild levels of violence and swearing is 15+.</li>
   <li>all others are "All Ages".</li>
  </ul>
