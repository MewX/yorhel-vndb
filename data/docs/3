:SUB:General info
<dl>
 <dt>*Type</dt><dd>
  Is the release complete, partial or a trial version?
  Complete releases have everything.
  Partial releases have most of the game, but there are things still waiting
  to be released.
  Trial versions are heavily cut down and free releases so that you can
  experience a game before you buy it. Sometimes, trial versions are cut
  down for web transmission and do not completely represent the finished product.
 </dd><dt>*Title (romaji)</dt><dd>
  The name of the release, in the Latin character set (using Romanisation or translation)
 </dd><dt>Original title</dt><dd>
  If the name is officially under a different title (usually because of different
  character sets), put the original title here.

  use the appropriate term on the release page.
