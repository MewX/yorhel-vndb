:TITLE:Development roadmap
:INC:index


:SUB:Some notes
This TODO list is just a place for Yorhel to write down his plans and ideas
for the upcoming versions of VNDB. Keep in mind that probably not everything
written down here will actually see the light of day.<br />
<br />
The full source code of the site is available on a
<a href="http://git.blicky.net/vndb.git/">git repository</a>, you can use it
to track changes to the code or even to run your own version of VNDB.<br />
<br />
There is a <a href="http://beta.vndb.org/">beta version</a> of VNDB available
for testing. New features will be implemented there and tested before getting
uploaded to the actual website. Everyone is free to play around and use that
beta version as a sandbox. Keep in mind, however, that all changes you make
on the beta are not permanent, and will be reverted whenever the beta is
synchronised with a more recent version of the database.<br /><br />
Feel free to comment about the TODO list and to suggest new features on the
<a href="/t/db">discussion board</a> or on <a href="irc://irc.synirc.net/vndb">
IRC</a>.
