:TITLE:The VNDB TODO list
:INC:index


:SUB:Some notes
This TODO list is just a place for Yorhel to write down his plans and ideas
for the upcoming versions of VNDB. Keep in mind that probably not everything
written down here will actually see the light of day.<br /><br />
The full source code of the website is available through SVN: svn://yorhel.nl/vndb/,
anonymous read access is allowed. The code is also available through HTTP using
the <a href="http://svn.yorhel.nl/vndb/">Web SVN</a>.<br /><br />
There is a <a href="http://beta.vndb.org/">beta version</a> of VNDB available
for testing. New features will be implemented there and tested before getting
uploaded to the actual website. Everyone is free to play around and use that
beta version as a sandbox. Keep in mind, however, that all changes you make
on the beta are not permanent, and will be reverted whenever I synchronise the
beta with a more recent version of the database.<br /><br />
Feel free to comment about the TODO list and to suggest new features on the
<a href="http://forum.vndb.org/">forums</a> or on <a href="irc://irc.synirc.net/vndb">
IRC</a>.

:SUB:Staff &amp; character database implementation ideas
<p>
 (These are still just ideas, feedback is most welcome)
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Add "person" database</li>
 <li>Create a link between VN entries and persons<ul>
  <li>Multiple persons per VN entry</li>
  <li>Add a "role" to every person &lt;&gt; vn link (static/dynamic?)</li>
  <li>Only add staff for the original release, and only the important roles:<br />
   <i>Story, Art, Music<br />
    I don't think we're interested in the people who wrote the engine
    or translated the game.</i></li>
 </ul>
 <li>Add "characters" database</li>
 <li>Create a link between VN entries and characters, same as with persons<br />
  <i>Only for characters in the original release</i></li>
 <li>Add a "voiced by" link between characters and persons<ul>
  <li>Only the voice actresses of the first voiced release of the game should be mentioned.</li>
  <li>This won't work when a character is voiced more than one person (e.g. appears in
   multiple games with different cast, or the child version is voiced by someone else)</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
