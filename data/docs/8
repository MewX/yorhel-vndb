:SUB:Staff &amp; character database implementation ideas
<p>
 (These are still just ideas, feedback is most welcome)
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Add "person" database</li>
 <li>Create a link between VN entries and persons<ul>
  <li>Multiple persons per VN entry</li>
  <li>Add a "role" to every person &lt;&gt; vn link (static/dynamic?)</li>
  <li>Only add staff for the original release, and only the important roles:<br />
   <i>Story, Art, Music<br />
    I don't think we're interested in the people who wrote the engine
    or translated the game.</i></li>
 </ul>
 <li>Add "characters" database</li>
 <li>Create a link between VN entries and characters, same as with persons<br />
  <i>Only for characters in the original release</i></li>
 <li>Add a "voiced by" link between characters and persons<br />
  <i>Only the voice actresses of the first voiced release of the game
   should be mentioned.</i></li>
</ul>


:SUB:Stalled
<p>
 Recommendation systems have been stalled for now, I prefer to concentrate
 on the encyclopedic part of VNDB at this moment. A proper recommendation
 system may be implemented in the future, though.
