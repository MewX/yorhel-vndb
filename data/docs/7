:SUB:Goal
<p>
 Our primary goal is building a large, comprehensive and up-to-date database for
 information about all existing visual novels. VNDB aims to be a central place
 too look up general information about the visual novels themselves, as well as
 practical information around it, like available releases, localisations and
 producers.<br />
 Our secondary goal is to promote the wonderful medium called visual novels to
 a broader audience, an audience not limited only to people who can understand
 Japanese, but to anyone interested in literature, anime, manga or games,
 regardless of their geographical location or cultural differences.
