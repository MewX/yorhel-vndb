:SUB:Goal
<p>
 Our primary goal is building a large, comprehensive and up-to-date database for
 information about all existing visual novels. VNDB aims to be a central place
 to look up general information about the visual novels themselves, as well as
 practical information around it, like available releases, localisations and
 producers.<br />
 Our secondary goal is to promote the wonderful medium called visual novels to
 a broader audience, an audience not limited only to people who can understand
 Japanese, but to anyone interested in literature, anime, manga or games,
 regardless of their geographical location or cultural differences.

:SUB:Genesis
<p>
 It all started right after <a href="/u2">yorhel</a> finished reading
 <a href="/v17">Ever17</a>. Highly impressed by the masterpiece, several
 questions came to his mind: After learning about visual novels, why did it
 still take several months to find this game? Why hasn't he ever heard about it before?
 How can a visual novel of that quality go by unnoticed in almost all online
 anime and gaming communities? And more importantly: Are there more visual
 novels like that out there?<br />
 <br />
 VNDB was born to answer that last question. The complete lack of any central
 resource for, or even a simple list of visual novels made it very hard to
 find new games or get a good overview of what was available. Having a central
 and well-organized place where everyone can share their information and knowledge
 about visual novels would solve this problem.<br />
 <br />
 After a short three weeks of hard work, the first version of VNDB saw the light
 of day in September 2007. The obscurity and small fanbase around visual novels,
 combined with the bare minimum of features and the rigid contribution system
 in use at the time, made that the database only grew at a slow pace. But with time
 more people learned about VNDB, new and advanced features were being introduced,
 and in response more visitors started contributing information. The introduction
 of an improved and open contribution system in February 2008 motivated even more
 users to submit information, and as of September 2008 - a year after the initial
 version of VNDB - the database catalogues more than 1000 visual novels and 2000
 releases, which still continues to grow in size and quality today.
