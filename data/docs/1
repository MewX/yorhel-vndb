<p>
 The contents of the story and the general feeling the characters give.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Action</dt><dd>
  The story has fast paced scenes and plenty of explosions or gun battles.
  Or lots of running...
 </dd><dt>Comedy</dt><dd>
  The story is light-hearted and makes you laugh, either by the un-seriousness
  or by character design.
 </dd><dt>Drama</dt><dd>
  The story takes a very serious path, often involving real-life scenarios
  in which you could relate to.
  A slice-of-life, with it's ups and downs.
 </dd><dt>Fantasy</dt><dd>
  Is it actually possible? Plenty of <i>Mahou Shoujo</i> and transformations,
  parallel universes and witches abound! Maybe pigs fly...
 </dd><dt>Horror</dt><dd>
  Plenty of blood and guts laying around. The guy with the knife looks
  suspicious.
 </dd><dt>Mystery</dt><dd>
  Suspense, tension and a little bit of morning dew makes a mystery game. 
  Something has happened, so work it out! Alternatively, hide under a rock.
 </dd><dt>Romance</dt><dd>
  Pull some heart-strings, get intimate with another character, and have some fun!
  Plenty of dating or some fanservice.
 </dd><dt>School Life</dt><dd>

  It seems like a chore to us, but the characters like learning.
  Maybe it's the people they meet? Or the lunch they share...

  Science Fiction. Using intelligence and building something not available
  today but certainly possible in real-life.

:SUB:Gameplay
<p>
 This category is used to describe the gameplay or game engine.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>NVL</dt><dd>
  All games where the text is overlaid on the background and there is no special
  dialog-box fall under this category.
 </dd><dt>ADV</dt><dd>
  The text is presented in a special window, usually at the bottom of the screen.
  Also known as Adventure or AVG.
  In some (rare) cases a game will switch between both styles, for these games both
  the <i>NVL</i> and <i>ADV</i> categories should be selected.
 </dd><dt>Action</dt><dd>
  This category indicates that the game includes a gameplay that challenges the
  player's speed, dexterity and reaction time. Common examples are fighting games,
  puzzles that should be solved within a short time limit, and shooter games.
 </dd><dt>RPG</dt><dd>
  Abbreviation for Role Playing Game. An RPG is a game in which you assume the
  role of a character introduced to a vast world to be explored. Games typically
  place emphasis on gaining equipment and experience points through fighting enemies
  in order to advance through different levels.
 </dd><dt>Strategy</dt><dd>
  A strategy game is one that challenges the player to think critically in order
  to achieve victory.
 </dd><dt>Simulation</dt><dd>

</dl>


:SUB:Plot
<p>
 Indicates the plot type of a game. There are only two options: <i>Branching</i> and
 <i>Linear</i>.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Linear</dt><dd>
  A game with a linear plot has a static story; it is not possible to get different paths
  or endings. Many games in this category do not prompt the player with choices and simply
  tell the story as it is. This is, however, not a rule: it is also possible for a game
  to provide choices, but they have no influence on the story itself. (e.g.
  <a href="/v3">Utawarerumono</a>)
 </dd><dt>Branching</dt><dd>
  A game with a branching plot has a story whose path is directly affected by choices
  made by the player during the game. These different paths are sometimes referred to
  as "arcs" when they pertain to the stories of different female characters within a game.
