:TITLE:Adding/Editing a Producer
:INC:index


:SUB:When to add a producer
<p>A producer entry may be created in one of the following scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>When it is needed to link the developer or publisher to a release entry.
In this case, the producer is required to have released at least one completed
product.  This means that translation projects and starting developers may only
be added when they've actually finished a project.</li>
<li>When it is needed to link two or more producer entries together to provide
a correct view of the relations between producers. The producer entries that
are being linked together should qualify for the first criteria, and need to be
linked to at least one release entry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Producer entries that do not qualify for either rule may be deleted after a
while.</p>
