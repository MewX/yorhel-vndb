:SUB:When to add a producer
<p>
 A producer entry should be created when adding a release of a visual novel made by a
 producer not yet listed in the database. Producers that don't have any releases listed
 in the database may be deleted after a while, so only create an entry if you're going to
 link it to a release. For a producer to be listed, they're required to have at least
 released one completed product. Which means that for translation projects, only add the
 group as a producer when they've actually finished a project.
