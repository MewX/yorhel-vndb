:SUB:Aliases
<p>
 People involved in visual novels production are often hide behind multiple aliases. These
 aliases could be listed here. Add only aliases that are actually used in VN credits.
 Sometimes names with different japanese spelling are romanized equally. You may add such
 aliases, but then original spelling should be used when name is being looked up in the VN
 staff edit form.
