:TITLE:Frequently Asked Questions
:INC:index


:SUB:What is a Visual Novel?
<p>
 A visual novel can be seen as a combination of a novel and a computer game:
 they're computer games with a large text based storyline and only little
 interaction of the player. A typical visual novel consists of text over
 an anime-style background image and is accompanied by background music.
 Throughout the game, the player usually has to answer a few questions which will
 have an effect on the story, thus playing a visual novel a second time while
 giving other answers may result in an entirely different plot.<br />
 <br />
 For more information see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Novel">
 the Wikipedia article on visual novels</a> or the description on
 <a href="http://visual-novels.net/vn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=259&amp;Itemid=47">Visual-Novels.net</a>.
 To get a general idea of the genre, try one of the free short visual novels from

:SUB:How about Eroge, H-Games and Dating Sims?
<p>
 An eroge or H-game is basically any Japanese game that features sexual
 content. Many visual novels are eroge and many eroge are visual novels,
 but this is not a rule. The definition of dating sim is a bit more vague,
 but it's usually the same as a visual novel, except that a dating sim
 generally uses a gameplay based on statistics.<br />
 <br />
 There are no strict bounds to the definition of "visual novel", most eroge and
 dating sims include elements of visual novels, but may - strictly speaking -
 not be visual novels themselves. VNDB has its own rules for inclusion in the
 database, see the <a href="/d2">guidelines</a> for more information.
</p>


:SUB:Why a Visual Novel Database?
<p>
 The internet is large, very large, but the number of English resources
 related to visual novels is only very limited. VNDB attempts to collect
 and present as much information as possible that would otherwise be very
 hard to find for the English speaking audience. This way fans can easily
 keep track of new releases and localizations of their favorite games,
 while not having to browse numerous of indistinct Japanese websites.
</p>


:SUB:How can I help VNDB?
<p>
 There are many ways to contribute to VNDB. First of all you can freely
 edit all information found on this website, so if you find any errors
 just click the "edit" link on the top right of the page. You can also
 add new information (visual novels, producers, releases) to the database,
 though please search the database before you do in order to prevent
 duplicate pages.<br />
 <br />
 To discuss about new features or to help the development of the website
 itself, feel free to participate on the <a href="/t">discussion board</a>
 or join us on IRC at <a href="irc://irc.synirc.net/vndb">#vndb @ irc.synirc.net</a>.
 If you aren't used to IRC or are just too lazy to install a client, you can

:SUB:Where can I download the Visual Novels?
<p>
 Not here. We do not provide any links to direct downloads, torrents or
 other means of downloading games. We do, however, link to the official
 homepages of the producers, who may provide free trials or even full
 game downloads.
</p>


:SUB:Can you recommend me a Visual Novel?
<p>
 Asking for recommendations on the discussion board or on IRC is usually not a
 good idea, for various reasons.  If you're looking for VNs that most people
 have played, check out the <a href="/v/all?s=pop;o=d">popularity rankings</a>.
 If you're interested in VNs that are generally considered "good" or "awesome",
 check out the <a href="/v/all?s=rating;o=d">ratings</a>. If you're interested
 in a more personal answer, you can compare the vote lists of our
 <a href="/u/all">users</a> with your own and decide what to read next based
 on that.
</p>


:SUB:Can I link to VNDB?
<p>
 Of course you can! We even have some icons you could use to link to and promote
 VNDB. Direct linking is, unlike with all other images on this site, allowed.<br />
