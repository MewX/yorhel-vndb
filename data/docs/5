:SUB:Romanization
<p>
 The main audience of VNDB are the English speaking fans of visual novels. In
 creating the database, we assume the intended audience can't read or recognise
 anything not written in the roman script. Therefore, romanization is applied
 to many fields in the database: The main title of visual novels, releases and
 producers should all be properly romanized if they arent in roman script
 already.<br />
 To keep the database consistent, we have decided to use
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization">Hepburn romanization</a>
 for all fields. This is also consistent with
 <a href="http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Romanisation">AniDBs romanization</a>.
</p>


:SUB:Capitalization
<p>
 Some Japanese producers use titles for their games that are already in the roman
 alphabet. However - as the disctinction in uppercase and lowercase characters
 does not exist in Japanese - these titles are often entirely in uppercase or
 lowercase. If there is no real reason for this choise of capitalization, these
 titles and names should be properly converted to normal English capitalization
 (as described <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization">on
 Wikipedia</a>) for titles and names before being entered in the database.
