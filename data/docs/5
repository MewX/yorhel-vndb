:SUB:Romanization
<p>
 The main audience of VNDB are the English speaking fans of visual novels. In
 creating the database, we assume the intended audience can't read or recognise
 anything not written in the roman script. Therefore, romanization is applied
 to many fields in the database: The main title of visual novels, releases and
 producers should all be properly romanized if they arent in roman script
 already.<br />
 To keep the database consistent, we have decided to use
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization">Hepburn romanization</a>
 for all fields. This is also consistent with
 <a href="http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Romanisation">AniDBs romanization</a>.
 <br />
 For English (or other foreign) words in a non-roman script, the original word
 should be used as long as it is the intended effect. If those words are in a
 non-roman script, a suitable romanisation technique should be used.
</p>


:SUB:Capitalization
<p>
 It occasionally happens that official titles or names are either entirely in
 uppercase or lowercase characters. If there is no real reason for this choise
 of capitalization (e.g. it's not an acronym), these titles and names should be
 properly converted to normal English capitalization (as described
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization">on Wikipedia</a>) before
 being entered in the database.<br />
 This only applies to the romanized titles and the main title of a visual novel
 entry, the 'Original title' field of producer and release entries should still
 use the official capitalization.
</p>


:SUB:Name Order
<p>
 In most English speaking countries, names are given in a "given name, family
 name" order.  This is called "Western Order".  In English, you call someone
 using their given name if you know them well, otherwise use their title and
 family name.
 <br />
 In Japanese (and some other languages too), names are given in "family name,
 given name" order.  We call this "Japanese Order".  In Japanese you can call
 someone using either name with an appropriate suffix.
 <br />
 To aid English speakers, some resources (e.g. wikipedia) use Japanese names in
 Western order.  Here on vndb.org, we prefer to use the order that the original
 game used.
 <br />
 That is, if it was originally a Japanese game with Japanese character names,
 use Japanese order.
 <br />
 If the game is originally English, or a character has a completely foreign
 name (Mary Smith), use Western order.
</p> 


:SUB:Edit Summaries
<p>
 Every edit to any page has a required "Edit summary" box, this allows you to
 explain yourself on what your edit is about without cluttering the main page.
 You can say why you've modified the description, changed a link, or show where
 you obtained some information (so that other contributors can verify it).
 Perhaps you want to add a visual novel to the database but are unable to find
 more information for it.  If you say so here, another contributor is bound to
 finish it off.
</p>


:SUB:Descriptions From External Sources
<p>
 It is possible to add a description or notes to visual novel, producer and release entries
 in the database. While original descriptions are preferred, using descriptions from external
 resources is allowed, provided the source is properly credited. The preferred form to credit
 external resources is by adding the following template to the bottom of the description:<br />
 [From [url=<b>URL</b>]<b>title or author</b>[/url]]<br />
 This would result in, for example, '[From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/Wiki/Ever17">Wikipedia</a>]'
 for descriptions taken from Wikipedia. If the description is not literally taken from the
 source but has some modifications, the 'From' should be replaced with something similar,
 indicating that it's modified, e.g. 'Edited from', 'Based on'.<br />
 As it is not allowed to provide links to websites providing or promoting illigal downloads,
 the URL part should be left out for such descriptions.
