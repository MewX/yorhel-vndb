:SUB:General info
<dl>
 <dt>*Title</dt><dd>
  The title of the visual novel as it is known to the English speaking audience. If
  there is no English version of the game available, you should either specify the
  romanized (recommended) or translated (not recommended) version of the original
  title.
 </dd><dt>Aliases</dt><dd>
  Visual novels can be known under several names, use this field to add any aliases
  and acronyms used around the net. Official titles of releases should not be added
  here, as these are already listed in the releases.
 </dd><dt>*Description</dt><dd>
  Short description of the main story.
 </dd><dt>Length</dt><dd>
  Very rough estimate of the time required to finish all endings of the visual novel.
  To determine the length of a game, it's often better to ignore this time indication
  and instead compare it with other games you've played. It's all relative, after all.
 </dd><dt>External links</dt><dd>
  Links to external resources about this visual novel. To get the URLs, go to the
  sites (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://visual-novels.net/">
  Visual-novels.net</a> and <a href="http://cisvisual.net/">CISVisual.net</a>),
  search for a page about the game, and determine the ID or name of that page to fill
  out in the text boxes. Do not specify the full URL, we only need a small part of
  it!
 </dd><dt>Related anime</dt><dd>
  Some visual novels (e.g. <a href="/v4">Clannad</a> and <a href="/v3">Utawarerumono</a>)
  have anime adaptions, and some visual novels were adapted from an anime series. Use
  this field to specify these related anime for the visual novel.<br />
  Anime should be specified using <a href="http://anidb.net/">AniDB</a> IDs. To add an
  anime, just search for it on AniDB and add the numeric ID of the entry (found in the
  <i>aid=xxx</i> part of the URL) to the edit field. Multiple IDs should be seperated
  with a whitespace.<br />
  If the visual novel already has a relation with an other visual novel, and both games
  have an anime adaption, the same anime does not have to be added to both games. For
  example, <a href="/v264">Da Capo</a> has two anime adaptions
  (<a href="http://anidb.net/a837">837</a>, <a href="http://anidb.net/a2832">2832</a>),
  and <a href="/v266">Da Capo II</a> as well. (<a href="http://anidb.net/a5419">5419</a>,
  <a href="http://anidb.net/a5652">5652</a>) But the relations for Da Capo II do not
  have to be added to Da Capo and vice versa - the internal visual novel relations will
  take care of that.<br />
  After submitting a new AniDB ID, VNDB will automatically fetch information about the
  anime and will present that on the site. This action can take a few minuts to - in the
  worst case - hours. In that time you will see the ID of the anime, but not the title
  and links to AnimeNFO and Anime News Network. It is not possible to manually add this
  information, this will be fetched automatically!

:SUB:Categories
<p>
 It is possible to select relevant categories for visual novels, where the relevance
 can be ranked using a number from 0 to 3, where 0 indicates the category does not
 apply at all, and 3 means that the category is very dominant in the game.<br />
 See <a href="/d1">Categories</a> for descriptions about each category.<br />
 Just as with the <i>Length</i> field, this information is very subjective. Just
 use the category descriptions and common sense to determine which categories to
 select and what relevance to apply.
