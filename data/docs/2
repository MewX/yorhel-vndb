:TITLE:Adding/Editing a Visual Novel
:INC:index

:SUB:When to add a visual novel
<p>
 To be included in this database, a game needs to use the <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_mode">novel narrative</a>
 consistently for telling its story. Examples include describing <a
 href="http://s.vndb.org/sf/58/258.jpg">visuals</a>, <a
 href="http://s.vndb.org/sf/63/2663.jpg">events</a>, <a
 href="http://s.vndb.org/sf/74/274.jpg">character actions</a> or <a
 href="http://s.vndb.org/sf/49/449.jpg">thoughts</a>.<br />
 <br />
 This storytelling needs to be uninterrupted* for a significant length and
 employing one of the known Visual Novel presentation methods such as <a
 href="http://s.vndb.org/sf/40/3440.jpg">ADV</a>, <a
 href="http://s.vndb.org/sf/52/3152.jpg">NVL</a> and their <a
 href="http://s.vndb.org/sf/39/339.jpg">variations</a>.<br />
 *Uninterrupted by gameplay sequences, not by choices or simple map
 movement.<br />
 <br />
 Note: In some special cases, a game may be added even if it does not adhere to
 the above points. However, this is the decision of the moderators. Do not add
 a game yourself expecting it to be an exception to the above rules.<br />
 See also the <a href="/d15">list of special games</a>.
</p>

:SUB:General info
<dl>
 <dt>Title (romaji)</dt><dd>
  The title should be based upon the title of the original release.<br />
  If the title uses the Latin alphabet, use our <a href="/d5.2">capitalisation guidelines</a>.<br />
  Otherwise, <a href="/d5.1">romanise</a> according to our guidelines.
 </dd><dt>Original title</dt><dd>
  If the name is officially under a different title (usually because of different
  character sets), put the original title here.
 </dd><dt>Aliases</dt><dd>
  Visual novels can be known under several names, use this field to add any aliases
  and acronyms used around the net. Official titles of releases should not be added
  here, as these are already listed in the releases.
 </dd><dt>Description</dt><dd>
  Short description of the main story.
 </dd><dt>Length</dt><dd>
  Very rough estimate of the time required to finish all endings of the visual novel.
  To determine the length of a game, it's often better to ignore this time indication
  and instead compare it with other games you've played. It's all relative, after all.
 </dd><dt>External links</dt><dd>
  Links to external resources about this visual novel. To get the URLs, go to the
  sites (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://novelnews.net/">
  Novelnews.net</a>, <a href="http://renai.us/">Renai.us</a> and
  <a href="http://visual-novels.net/">Visual-novels.net</a>),
  search for a page about the game, and determine the ID or name of that page to fill
  out in the text boxes. Do not specify the full URL, we only need a small part of
  it!
 </dd><dt>Related anime</dt><dd>
  Some visual novels (e.g. <a href="/v4">Clannad</a> and <a href="/v3">Utawarerumono</a>)
  have anime adaptions, and some visual novels were adapted from an anime series. Use
  this field to specify these related anime for the visual novel.<br />
  Anime should be specified using <a href="http://anidb.net/">AniDB</a> IDs. To add an
  anime, just search for it on AniDB and add the numeric ID of the entry (found in the
  <i>aid=xxx</i> part of the URL) to the edit field. Multiple IDs should be seperated
  with a whitespace.<br />
  If the visual novel already has a relation with an other visual novel, and both games
  have an anime adaption, the same anime does not have to be added to both games. For
  example, <a href="/v264">Da Capo</a> has two anime adaptions
  (<a href="http://anidb.net/a837">837</a>, <a href="http://anidb.net/a2832">2832</a>),
  and <a href="/v266">Da Capo II</a> as well. (<a href="http://anidb.net/a5419">5419</a>,
  <a href="http://anidb.net/a5652">5652</a>) But the relations for Da Capo II do not
  have to be added to Da Capo and vice versa - the internal visual novel relations will
  take care of that.<br />
  After submitting a new AniDB ID, VNDB will automatically fetch information about the
  anime and will present that on the site. This action can take a few minutes to - in the
  worst case - hours. In that time you will see the ID of the anime, but not the title
  and links to AnimeNFO and Anime News Network. It is not possible to manually add this
  information, this will be fetched automatically!
 </dd>
</dl>


:SUB:Staff & Cast
<p>It's possible to link VN entries to <a href="/d16">staff entries</a> in the
staff and cast tabs.</p>

:SUBSUB:Staff
<p>
 The staff tab lists the people or groups involved in the creation of the
 visual novel. The following roles can be used:
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Scenario</dt><dd>&nbsp;</dd>
 <dt>Script</dt><dd>&nbsp;</dd>
 <dt>Character design</dt><dd>&nbsp;</dd>
 <dt>Composer</dt><dd>&nbsp;</dd>
 <dt>Director</dt><dd>&nbsp;</dd>
 <dt>Artist</dt><dd>&nbsp;</dd>
 <dt>Vocals</dt><dd>Vocals used in the music. Not to be used for voice actors of characters, these should be listed under <a href="/d2.3.2">cast</a> instead.</dd>
 <dt>Staff</dt><dd>Used for any additional minor roles, use the "notes" field to indicate the staff's involvement.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A few guidelines:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Add major staff only.</li>
 <li>If someone performed several important jobs, add multiple entries with different major roles.</li>
 <li>Don't add a person as "Staff" if he/she is already credited with some of the major roles. Mention this in the notes field instead.</li>
</ul>

:SUBSUB:Cast
<p>
 The cast tab lists the voice actors for each character. This tab is only
 available when characters have been linked to the visual novel.
</p>

:SUB:Image
<p>
 Every visual novel should have an image, preferably one of the official cover
 art of one of the releases. In some cases, especially with doujin games, if there is
 no official cover art available, a general image from the game's homepage or a
 screenshot of the game itself could be used instead.<br />
 Images can be uploaded in JPEG or PNG format, and should not be larger than 5 MiB.
 All images larger than 256x400px will automatically be resized to fit on the page.
 <br /><br />
 The NSFW warning should be used in cases where the cover art is not safe for work.
 To determine what is safe for work and what is not, use the following guidelines:
</p><ul>
 <li>Nudity is only safe if the sexual characteristics are covered or hidden</li>
 <li>Bikini, pantsu and other underwear are only safe if they contain no implicit
  indication of sexual anatomy</li>
 <li>If the characters pose is overly sexually suggestive, it's NSFW</li>
 <li>If multiple characters are portrayed and they are engaged in physical contact
  that may be considered as (a precursor to) sexual contact, then it's NSFW as well.
 </li>
 <li>NSFW is solely determined by the graphics: Images that contain suggestive
  text but are not otherwise NSFW are safe.</li>
</ul><p>
 Even with these guidelines it may not always be easy to determine whether an image
 is safe or not. When in doubt, it's often best to go for NSFW.
</p>


:SUB:Relations
<p>
 Visual novel relations can be used to indicate what games are related to each
 other.<br />
 When adding a relation, the reverse relation will automatically be added to
 the other visual novel. E.g. if you add game x as a sequel to game y, then game
 y will automatically be added as a prequel to game x. You do not have to edit
 both games.<br />
 Only specify <b>direct</b> relations. If one game 1 is listed to have a relation
 with game 2, and game 2 has a relation with game 3, then game 3 does not have
 to be added as a relation to game 1. This may sound a bit confusing at first,
 but you will understand when you look at the relation graphs. When editing relations,
 always try to think about the relations between all related games - as shown in
 the graph - instead of only looking at the specific visual novel you're editing.
 <br />
 The "official" checkbox can be used to indicate whether relation is an official
 one or not.  A relation is official if both games were published by the same
 brand, or at least the publisher of the earlier game has given persmission to
 create the later game. In general: fandiscs and games of the same series are
 official, while fan fiction is not.
 <br />
 There is a static list of relations to choose from (as described below). As with
 many things, the relations between games can in reality be more complex than these
 options could describe. Simply choose the option you think is closest to describing
 the actual relation when you're not sure which one to choose.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Sequel</dt><dd>
  Continuation of the story. &lt;=&gt;<i>Prequel</i>.
 </dd><dt>Prequel</dt><dd>
  The story happens before the original story.&lt;=&gt;<i>Sequel</i>.
 </dd><dt>Same setting</dt><dd>
  Same universe, world, reality and timeline, but completely different characters.
  The definition of "setting" is not always easy to define, but usually it
  means that if places or items not existing in the real world described in one
  game also exist in the other game, you could use this relation.
 </dd><dt>Alternative version</dt><dd>
  Same setting, same characters, but the story is told differently.
 </dd><dt>Shares characters</dt><dd>
  Different story, but shares some characters.
 </dd><dt>Side story</dt><dd>
  The story takes place sometime during the parent storyline. &lt;=&gt;<i>Parent story</i>
 </dd><dt>Parent story</dt><dd>
  Opposite of <i>Side story</i>.
 </dd><dt>Same series</dt><dd>
  The games are part of the same series.
 </dd><dt>Fandisc</dt><dd>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_disc">Fandisc</a>.
 </dd><dt>Original game</dt><dd>
  The opposite of fandisc.
 </dd>

:SUB:Screenshots
Each visual novel entry can have at most 10 screenshots. Screenshots can be
uploaded in JPEG and PNG format. The uploaded screenshots are strictly
moderated to follow the guidelines listed below. It is highly recommended to
follow our <a href="/d13">instructions on creating good screenshots</a> if you
don't want your efforts to go to waste.
<ul>
 <li>All images must be in the highest native resolution of the VN. The native resolution
  is the resolution for which the bitmap images are made, this is 640x480 or 800x600 for most
  entries. Any upscaling or downscaling, whether done by the game engine itself or by manually
  using an image editor, is <b>not</b> allowed!</li>
 <li>All images have to be screenshots of the <b>game itself</b>, this means that any window
  borders will have to be removed before uploading. We are neither interested in your heavily
  modified window borders nor in your awesome AGTH setup.</li>
 <li>At least half of the images should be actual screenshots of the game. That is, they should
  include character sprites or some form of dialog or user interface. Plain event CG images
  without any text or interfaces are allowed to demonstrate the drawing style, but should
  not dominate over the other screenshots.</li>
 <li>Uploading screenshots with erotic content is allowed, as long as the ratio of erotic/non-erotic
  screenshots is somewhat in line with the actual erotic/non-erotic ratio of the VN itself. For example,
  if a 10 hour VN has only 2 H-scenes of 10 minutes, it wouldn't be appropriate to upload more than 2 or 3
  erotic images. On the other hand, if a VN is mostly about sex, it wouldn't make sense to upload only one
  erotic screenshot. It is advised - even for the sex-only games - to have at least one non-erotic screenshot.</li>
 <li>Keep the spoilers to a minimum. It's impossible to upload screenshots that are completely devoid
  of spoilers, but it is possible to keep this to a minimum. I.e. screenshots early in the beginning of
  the VN are prefered, and shots later in the game are fine as long as they don't reveal any major information
  about the plot.</li>
 <li>Images that are NSFW should be flagged as such, see the <a href="#4">image</a> guidelines above.</li>
 <li>Screenshots have to be unmarked: they shouldn't contain any copyright information, website URL,
  or other text that's not present in the original screenshot.</li>
 <li>Screenshots should preferably be of the English or original (Japanese) releases. Other languages are
  allowed, but the number of images should be kept to a minimum.</li>
 <li>Do not post different language versions of the same screenshot, this is not a comparision gallery.</li>
</ul>
