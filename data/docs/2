 Blahblah about what we define as VN...
</p>


:SUB:General info
<dl>
 <dt>*Title</dt><dd>
  The title of the visual novel as it is known to the English speaking audience. If
  there is no English version of the game available, you should either specify the
  romanized (recommended) or translated (not recommended) version of the original
  title.
 </dd><dt>Aliases</dt><dd>
  Visual novels can be known under several names, use this field to add any aliases
  and acronyms used around the net. Official titles of releases should not be added
  here, as these are already listed in the releases.
 </dd><dt>*Description</dt><dd>
  Short description of the main story.
 </dd><dt>Length</dt><dd>
  Very rough estimate of the time required to finish all endings of the visual novel.
  To determine the length of a game, it's often better to ignore this time indication
  and instead compare it with other games you've played. It's all relative, after all.
 </dd><dt>External links</dt><dd>
  Links to external resources about this visual novel. To get the URLs, go to the
  sites (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://visual-novels.net/">
  Visual-novels.net</a> and <a href="http://cisvisual.net/">CISVisual.net</a>),
  search for a page about the game, and determine the ID or name of that page to fill
  out in the text boxes. Do not specify the full URL, we only need a small part of
  it!
 </dd><dt>Related anime</dt><dd>
  Some visual novels (e.g. <a href="/v4">Clannad</a> and <a href="/v3">Utawarerumono</a>)
  have anime adaptions, and some visual novels were adapted from an anime series. Use
  this field to specify these related anime for the visual novel.<br />
  Anime should be specified using <a href="http://anidb.net/">AniDB</a> IDs. To add an
  anime, just search for it on AniDB and add the numeric ID of the entry (found in the
  <i>aid=xxx</i> part of the URL) to the edit field. Multiple IDs should be seperated
  with a whitespace.<br />
  If the visual novel already has a relation with an other visual novel, and both games
  have an anime adaption, the same anime does not have to be added to both games. For
  example, <a href="/v264">Da Capo</a> has two anime adaptions
  (<a href="http://anidb.net/a837">837</a>, <a href="http://anidb.net/a2832">2832</a>),
  and <a href="/v266">Da Capo II</a> as well. (<a href="http://anidb.net/a5419">5419</a>,
  <a href="http://anidb.net/a5652">5652</a>) But the relations for Da Capo II do not
  have to be added to Da Capo and vice versa - the internal visual novel relations will
  take care of that.<br />
  After submitting a new AniDB ID, VNDB will automatically fetch information about the
  anime and will present that on the site. This action can take a few minutes to - in the
  worst case - hours. In that time you will see the ID of the anime, but not the title
  and links to AnimeNFO and Anime News Network. It is not possible to manually add this
  information, this will be fetched automatically!

:SUB:Categories
<p>
 It is possible to select relevant categories for visual novels, where the relevance
 can be ranked using a number from 0 to 3, where 0 indicates the category does not
 apply at all, and 3 means that the category is very dominant in the game.<br />
 See <a href="/d1">Categories</a> for descriptions about each category.<br />
 Just as with the <i>Length</i> field, this information is very subjective. Just
 use the category descriptions and common sense to determine which categories to
 select and what relevance to apply.
</p>


:SUB:Image
<p>
 Every visual novel should have an image, preferably one of the official cover
 art of one of the releases. In some cases, especially with doujin games, if there is
 no official cover art available, a general image from the game's homepage or a
 screenshot of the game itself could be used instead.<br />
 Images can be uploaded in JPEG or PNG format, and should not be larger than 500kB.
 All images larger than 256x400px will automatically be resized to fit on the page.
 Keep in mind that this resizing is done in a seperate process, so you will not
 immediately see the image after uploading. This processing often takes just a few
 seconds, and the image should be available shortly after you've submitted the form.
 <br /><br />
 The NSFW warning should be used in cases where the cover art is not safe for work.
 To determine what is safe for work and what is not, use the following guidelines:
</p><ul>
 <li>Nudity is only safe if the sexual characteristics are covered or hidden</li>
 <li>Bikini, pantsu and other underwear are only safe if they contain no implicit
  indication of sexual anatomy</li>
 <li>If the characters pose is overly sexually suggestive, it's NSFW</li>
 <li>If multiple characters are portrayed and they are engaged in physical contact
  that may be considered as (a precursor to) sexual contact, then it's NSFW as well.
 </li>
</ul><p>
 Even with these guidelines it may not always be easy to determine whether an image
 is safe or not. When in doubt, it's often best to go for NSFW.
</p>


:SUB:Relations
<p>
 Visual novel relations can be used to indicate what games are related to each
 other.<br />
 When adding a relation, the reverse relation will automatically be added to
 the other visual novel. E.g. if you add game x as a sequel to game y, then game
 y will automatically be added as a prequel to game x. You do not have to edit
 both games.<br />
 Only specify <b>direct</b> relations. If one game 1 is listed to have a relation
 with game 2, and game 2 has a relation with game 3, then game 3 does not have
 to be added as a relation to game 1. This may sound a bit confusing at first,
 but you will understand when you look at the relation graphs. When editing relations,
 always try to think about the relations between all related games - as shown in
 the graph - instead of only looking at the specific visual novel you're editing.
 <br />
 There is a static list of relations to choose from (as described below). As with
 many things, the relations between games can in reality be more complex than these
 options could describe. Simply choose the option you think is closest to describing
 the actual relation when you're not sure which one to choose.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Sequel</dt><dd>
  Continuation of the story. &lt;=&gt;<i>Prequel</i>.
 </dd><dt>Prequel</dt><dd>
  The story happens before the original story.&lt;=&gt;<i>Sequel</i>.
 </dd><dt>Same setting</dt><dd>
  Same universe, world, reality and timeline, but completely different characters.
  The definition of "setting" is not always easy to define, but usually it
  means that if places or items not existing in the real world described in one
  game also exist in the other game, you could use this relation.
 </dd><dt>Alternative setting</dt><dd>
  Same characters and (mostly) the same story, but set in a different universe,
  world, reality or timeline.
 </dd><dt>Alternative version</dt><dd>
  Same setting, same characters, but the story is told differently.
 </dd><dt>Same characters</dt><dd>
  Different story, but shares some characters.
 </dd><dt>Side story</dt><dd>
  The story takes place sometime during the parent storyline. &lt;=&gt;<i>Parent story</i>
 </dd><dt>Parent story</dt><dd>
  Opposite of <i>Side story</i>.
 </dd><dt>Summary</dt><dd>
  Summarizes full story, may contain additional stuff. &lt;=&gt;<i>Full story</i>.
 </dd><dt>Full story</dt><dd>
  Full version of the summarized story. &lt;=&gt;<i>Summary</i>.
 </dd><dt>Other</dt><dd>
  There is a relation, but it's not possible to describe it using the other available
  options. This is a relation that should rarely be used.
