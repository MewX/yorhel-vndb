:SUB:Tags
<p>
 To make sure interested people can find your post, all threads have 'tags'
 that define what the discussion is about. It's possible to add more than
 one tag to a thread. The following tags can be used:
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>db</dt><dd>
  VNDB Discussions. This is a general tag for threads not about any specific
  entry in the database.
 </dd><dt>v#</dt><dd>
  For discussions about a particular visual novel. The tag <i>v17</i>, for example,
  is used for all threads related to <a href="/v17">v17</a>.
 </dd><dt>p#</dt><dd>
  Same as <i>v#</i>, but for producers.
 </dd><dt>u#</dt><dd>
  The <i>u#</i> tag can be used to notify a user on this site about something
  he/she must see or to discuss about an edit he/she has made. This is similar
  to the 'private message' feature of most sites, except it's not 'private'...
 </dd><dt>an</dt><dd>
  Used for site announcements. Limited to moderators.
 </dd>
</dl>


:SUB:Formatting
<p>
 The following codes can be used to format your message:
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>X# or X#.#</dt><dd>
  A 'VNDBID', as we call them. These are numbers starting with a character (d, p, r, s, u or v),
  and are optionally followed by a period and a second number. VNDBIDs will automatically be converted
  into links to the page on the website. For example, typing 'v4.4' will result in '<a href="/v4.4">v4.4</a>'.
 </dd><dt>URL</dt><dd>
  Any URL (without the use of the [url]-tag, see below) will be converted into a link, similar to the
  VNDBIDs. Example: 'http://vndb.org/' will be formatted as '<a href="http://vndb.org/">link</a>'.
 </dd><dt>[url]</dt><dd>
  The classic BBCode [url]-tag. Can only be used in the form of <i>[url=link]link title[/url]</i>.<br />
  E.g. '[url=/v]List of visual novels[/url] and [url=http://blicky.net/]some external website[/url]'
  will be displayed as '<a href="/v">List of visual novels</a> and <a href="http://blicky.net/">some external website</a>'
 </dd><dt>[spoiler]</dt><dd>
  The [spoiler]-tag should be used to hide information that could spoil the enjoyment of playing the
  visual novel for people who haven't done so yet.
 </dd>
</dl>
<p>
 There is no [img]-tag and there won't likely ever be one, if you want to include
 screenshots or other images, please upload them to an external hosting service
 (e.g. <a href="http://tinypic.com/" rel="nofollow">TinyPic</a>) and link to them
 in your post.
