+ = implemented
- = planned

Always:
+ pm         notify for a new post or thread in my discussion board
+ dbdel      notify for the deletion of an entry I made or edited
+ listdel    notify for the deletion of an entry I voted on / have in my release list / wishlist

Option "Notify me about database entries I contributed to" (enabled by default)
+ dbedit     notify for each edit of an entry I made or edited

Option "Notify me for site announcements" (disabled by default - too many notifications otherwise)
+ announce   notify for each new thread in the 'an' board
