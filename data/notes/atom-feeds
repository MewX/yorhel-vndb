Atom Feeds

Last modified: 2010-11-13
Status: Implemented


New module: Multi::Feed
Automatically generates and updates the following feeds:
 www/feeds/
   announcements.atom
     Updated?: LISTEN 'newpost'; post.num = 1 and board = 'an'
               (what about an edit of the annoucement title/content?)
   changes.atom
     Updated?: LISTEN 'changes'
   posts.atom
     Updated?: LISTEN 'newpost'
               (what about edits of posts? title/contents can change...)
   released.atom (not implemented)
     Updated?: daily + LISTEN 'changes'; c.type = 'r'
               (more restrictions can be added if the generation time of this feed is long)

All feeds are updated once every 15 minutes; this is easier and less
error-prone than the above notify solutions that differ for each feed.
Assuming all feeds can be generated in one second, this takes
(1/(15*60))*100 = ~0.1% of server CPU time on average.
