Permanent VN/release filters

Last modified: 2011-01-01
Status: Implemented


Storage:
- format: the usual filter string (as used in fil=X query string)
- location: users_prefs, key = filter_(vn|release)


How to fetch entries within Perl with the filters applied:
  Special wrapper function for db(VN|Release)Get(), which does the following:

  # compatibility checking/converting
  function check_compat(fil, save):
    if filters_contain_old_stuff then
      fil = convert_old_stuff(filters)
      if save then
        save_preference(filter_vn, serialize_filter(filters))
      end if
    end if
    return fil

  function filVNGet(fil_overwrite, opts):
    if (not logged_in or not filter_preference) and not fil_overwrite then
      return dbFunc(opts)
    end if

    filters = check_compat(parse_filter(fil_overwrite || filter_preference), fil_overwrite?dontsave:save)

    # incorrect filters can trigger an error, catch such an error and remove
    # the preference if that was what caused the error
    if(fil_overwrite) # preferences can't cause the error
      return dbFunc(filters + opts);
    else
      try
        create_sql_savepoint()
        return dbFunc(filters + opts)
      error
        rollback_to_sql_savepoint()
        results = dbFunc(opts)
        # if the previous call also fails, the next command won't be executed
        delete_filters_preference()
        return results

  A filReleaseGet() would do something similar. In fact, it might make sense
  to combine it into a single function filFetchDB(type, fil, opts)
  Filters can be disabled by adding a '<filter_name> => undef' to opts.


All cases where the current code calls dbVNGet() should be checked and
considered for replacing with the above fetching function. Some cases are:
VN:
- Random visual novels on homepage
- "Random visual novel" menu link
- VN browser
  In this case the query string should overwrite preferences? Since
  the preference is loaded in the filter selector as a default anyway
- Tag page VN listing
  The tag_inc and tag_exc filters should be disabled here?
- Preferably also the random screenshots on the homepage. But this requires
  some more code changes.
Release:
- "Upcoming releases" and "Just released" on homepage
- Release browser
  Same note as VN browser above


Some cases that shouldn't be affected by the filter preferences:
- Edit histories
- User lists (votes, vnlist, wishlist)
- Tag link browser
- VN page release listing
- VN page relations listing
- Producer page VN/release listing
- Release page VN listing
- Database Statistics
  (Even if they should, I wouldn't do it. Too heavy on server resources)


User interface considerations:
- An extra button "Save as default" will be added to the filter selector if
  the visitor is logged in
- Ideally, there should be some indication that filters were applied to all
  places where they are used, with the possibility of changing them.
  (this is going to to be a pain to implement :-/)
