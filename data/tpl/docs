<h3>Elements</h3>
<p>
 ...own interpretation for now... (Should be documented at some time, too)
</p>


<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>
 This category is used to describe the gameplay or game engine.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Visual Novel</dt><dd>
  All games where the text is overlaid on the background and there is no special
  dialog-box fall under this category. Can be abbreviated as VN or NVL.
 </dd><dt>Adventure</dt><dd>
  This is the opposite of the <i>Visual Novel</i> category: The text is presented
  in a special window, usually at the bottom of the screen. In some (rare) cases
  a game will switch between both styles, for these games both the <i>Visual Novel</i>
  and <i>Adventure</i> categories should be selected. Can be abbreviated as ADV or AVG.
 </dd><dt>Action</dt><dd>
  This category indicates that the game includes a gameplay that challenges the
  player's speed, dexterity and reaction time. Common examples are fighting games,
  puzzles that should be solved within a short time limit, and shooter games.
 </dd><dt>RPG</dt><dd>
  Abbreviation for Role Playing Game. An RPG is a game in which you assume the
  role of a character introduced to a vast world to be explored. Games typically
  place emphasis on gaining equipment and experience points through fighting enemies
  in order to advance through different levels.
 </dd><dt>Strategy</dt><dd>
  A strategy game is one that challenges the player to think critically in order
  to achieve victory.
 </dd><dt>Simulation</dt><dd>
  A simulation game attempts to recreate aspects of reality and puts the player in
  control.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>
 Indicates the plot type of a game. There are only two options: <i>Branching</i> and
 <i>Linear</i>.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Linear</d><dd>
  A game with a linear plot has a static story; it is not possible to get different paths
  or endings. Many games in this category do not prompt the player with choices and simply
  tell the story as it is. This is, however, not a rule: it is also possible for a game
  to provide choises, but they have no influence on the story itself. (e.g.
  <a href="/v3">Utawarerumono</a>)
 </dd><dt>Branching</dt><dd>
  A game with a branching plot has a story whose path is directly affected by choices
  made by the player during the game. These different paths are sometimes referred to
  as "arcs" when they pertain to the stories of different female characters within a game.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Time</h3>
<p>
 Indicates the time period in which the story has been set.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Future</dt><dd>
  The game is set in a time beyond that of our own. Games may incorperate elements of
  future technologies or events yet-to-come.
 </dd><dt>Present</dt><dd>
  The game is set in the current day.
 </dd><dt>Past</dt><dd>
  The game is set in a time before our own. Games may or may not adhere to historic fact.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Place</h3>
<p>
 Indicates the place in which the story is told.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Earth</dt><dd>
  The game takes place on our own planet.
 </dd><dt>Fantasy World</dt><dd>
  The game takes place on another world. The game's environment could be similar
  to that of our own with a few significant changes, but it could also be
  radically different.
 </dd><dt>Space</dt><dd>
  The game takes place in the vacuum of space between celestial bodies. For example,
  this category can be used to define games where the characters may inhabit
  spaceships that journey across the universe.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Sexual content</h3>
<p>
 Indicates the types of sexual content that the game contains.
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>Sexual content</dt><dd>
  This is a generic category to indicate the presence of any sexual content in the
  game. If there is any such content, this category should be selected.
 </dd><dt>Bestiality</dt><dd>
  Sexual activity between characters and animals.<br />
  <i>No catgirls, I guess?</i>
 </dd><dt>Incest</dt><dd>
  Sexual activity between members of the same family. Most of the time under the
  justification of participants not blood related (step-sister etc.).
 </dd><dt>Lolicon</dt><dd>
  The usage of female characters with childlike features in sexual situations.
 </dd><dt>Shotacon</dt><dd>
  The usage of male characters with childlike features in sexual situations.
 </dd><dt>Yaoi</dt><dd>

  their will.
 </dd>
</dl>
